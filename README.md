####please _DO NOT_ edit on the `master` branch.
Here is the correct procedure:
1- create working branch from the current master.

2- Do the work in that branch.

3- Once done commit and push that branch on github.

4- Merge that branch with the master branch on _*github*_.

5- update your local repo with the master on github.
####How will this make difference?
This will help minimizing conflict, where you wil never be required to update your working branch from the upstream repo,
even in case of confilcts cherry-picking the desirable commits will be alot easier
